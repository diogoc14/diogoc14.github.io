        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm a first-year master's student at Instituto Superior Técnico with a passion for cybersecurity. I love tackling challenges and constantly learning new things in this ever-evolving field. Right now, I’m diving into resources to strengthen my understanding and technical skills.
            I'm particularly interested in securing networks, analyzing vulnerabilities, and exploring ways to defend against cyber threats. I enjoy hands-on problem-solving and digging into real-world security challenges. Always excited to learn, experiment, and push my knowledge further!</p>
