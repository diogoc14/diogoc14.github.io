            <h3>Network Security Course Project</h3>
            <p>This project aimed to design a secure environment based on a given business scenario. Working collaboratively with two colleagues, my primary contribution was setting up the infrastructure. I configured all essential machines, including the Web Server, Client, Database, and Firewalls, ensuring seamless communication within the defined network architecture.</p>

            <h3>Software Security Course Project</h3>
            <p>In collaboration with two colleagues, we developed a Python program capable of analyzing JavaScript code to detect explicit flows associated with known vulnerability patterns. This tool provided an automated approach to identifying security risks within the code.</p>
